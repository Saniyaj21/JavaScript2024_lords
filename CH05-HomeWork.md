Home Work questions for class 05 conditional statements

1. **Basic Loops**:

   - **Question**: Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop counter that starts at 10 and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.

2. **While Loop**:

   - **Question**: Write a `while` loop that prints the first 5 even numbers starting from 0.
   - **Hint**: Use a loop counter initialized to 0 and increment it by 2 in each iteration.

3. **Do-While Loop**:

   - **Question**: Write a `do-while` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.
   - **Hint**: Ensure the condition is checked after the loop body has executed.

4. **Break Statement**:

   - **Question**: Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10, but stops the loop when the number 7 is reached.
   - **Hint**: Use an `if` statement to check if the loop counter equals 7 and then use `break`.

5. **Continue Statement**:

   - **Question**: Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10, but skips the number 5.
   - **Hint**: Use an `if` statement to check if the loop counter equals 5 and then use `continue`.

6. **If-Else Statement**:

   - **Question**: Write an `if-else` statement that checks if a given number `x` is positive, negative, or zero, and prints an appropriate message.
   - **Hint**: Use nested `if` statements to handle all three conditions.

7. **Switch Statement**:

   - **Question**: Write a `switch` statement that takes a variable `day` (with values from 0 to 6) and prints the corresponding day of the week (e.g., 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).
   - **Hint**: Each `case` should correspond to a day of the week.

8. **Ternary Operator**:

   - **Question**: Use the ternary operator to check if a given number `y` is even or odd and print "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.
   - **Hint**: Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is even or odd.

9. **Combining Loops and Conditions**:

   - **Question**: Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 20. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, print "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
   - **Hint**: Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to check the conditions inside the loop.

10. **Complex Condition**:
    - **Question**: Write an `if-else` statement that takes a variable `temperature` and prints "Cold" if the temperature is below 15, "Warm" if it’s between 15 and 25, and "Hot" if it’s above 25.
    - **Hint**: Use compound conditions with logical operators `&&` to check for the range between 15 and 25.
